                    " Information in the St. Helens local history archives states that sandstone quarrying began here as early as 1730.",
                    " As the quarry expanded, the cost of purchasing land to open cast mine it increased, so it was decided to opt for a different method.",
                    " Instead of quarrying out the stone, they would mine it out, following a seam of stone until it ran out.",
                    " This resulted in the network of caves, tunnels and shafts we see today.",
                    " Rainford Delph is listed as a Colliery by 1854, under the ownership of Charles Howarth or Yorkshire Charlie as he was known locally by 1880.",
                    " Mining finally ceased and the woods and caverns were used as a game reserve by the Earl of Derby until 1939, when they became a storage facility for ammunition for the anti-aircraft position at Crank.",
                    " After the war, the caverns ceased use as a game reserve.",
                    " Today, Crank Caverns are not officially open to the public and due to their increasing instability, attempts have been made to close access to the caverns and tunnels themselves.",
                    " Despite this, the site is still physically accessible from a nearby public footpath and is still a draw for generations of curious locals who wish to explore, many having heard the numerous local myths and legends from an early age."
